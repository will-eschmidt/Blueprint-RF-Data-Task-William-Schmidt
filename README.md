This file contains the matrials for my coding assesment for MIT Blueprint labs. This is my first time doing anything other than regression in Stata, so forgive the messiness of my log file. I am eager to learn how to become better with it, so I used this opportunity to hone mu skills. They are commented on, however, errors are included so that I can show my thinking process as I progress through the exercise. In this file you will find the following:
- The uncleaned raw datafiles. The hd2010 through hd2015 files contain information regarding school identification, including if it is public or private and what types of degrees they are authorized to offer. It is from these files in whihc we constructed dummy variables to represent public versus private indicator variables as well as our indicator variable for whether or not the insitituion grants Bachelor's degrees. The sfa files contains informations about state, federal, and financial aid information from the IPEDS Universe. It was from this where we extracted yearly grant levels at the federal and state levels and enrollment of full time, first time students.
- A log file I used to construct the cleaned dataframe and that documents my creation of the graphs seen in Question 1 of my analysis and my regressions in question 2. It is commented on. 
- A log file used for my creation of the summary statistics in Question 4
- A pdf document that has information about the private school spending of 4 year colleges per coheort in 2015 in the state of TN.
- A pdf file of my analysis, with tables and pictures referenced in line for easy reference. 
- A clean .dta file of the infomration I used for questions 1-3 with the requested variables 
- A clean .dta file for demographic information of TN highschool students
- Two graphs requested in Question 1 (these can also be found in question 1 of my analysis) 

Thank you for your consideration. I hope to hear back from you soon!
